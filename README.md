How do I approach designing software?
I start by defining the requirements, then plan the architecture and design patterns to be used, focusing on modularity and scalability.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
It helped me improve my ability to create realistic textures, implement physics-based interactions, and design interactive elements in 3D environments.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed an iterative design process, starting with a basic layout, incrementally adding features, and continuously testing and refining the design.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The iterative design approach and emphasis on modularity can be applied to any future projects to ensure flexibility and ease of maintenance.
Program Development

How do I approach developing programs?
I begin with planning and understanding the problem, then write modular and testable code, continuously testing and refining as development progresses.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I used a combination of object-oriented programming and physics-based simulations to create realistic and interactive 3D environments.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was key in developing and refining features, allowing continuous improvement and adjustment based on testing and feedback.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My approach evolved to include more detailed planning, better modularization, and more frequent testing to catch and fix issues early.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science provides the skills and knowledge to solve complex problems, automate tasks, and create innovative solutions, essential for achieving my career goals.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
They enhance my understanding of visual representation of data, algorithms for rendering and simulation, and the creation of interactive applications, which are valuable in many educational fields.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
These skills are crucial for fields like game development, virtual reality, and data visualization, enabling me to create engaging and informative visual content.
